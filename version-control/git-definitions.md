# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control allows us to view the entire history of revisions and merge revisions made by different people

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a copy of your project to work on. You can add features to your project without effecting the working version.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

Committing saves all the staged files. It tells git that these files are ready to be added to the repo. A detailed message makes a good commit message. If you added a new header to a readme.md a good commit would be (git commit -m "added new header to readme"). The more detail the better

* What is a merge conflict?

Changing the same part of the same file differently in the two branches you're merging together is a conflict.
