#Name Scrambler Application

#Pseudocode

#First we must collect the name
#Make it lower case
#Put it into an array split it and reverse it so the last name is first
#Split the array even further or make two different arrays for first and last
#Change all the vowels to the next vowel then do the same consonants
#bring arrays together after splitter and show user their new words
