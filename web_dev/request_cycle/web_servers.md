1. Linux gives you complete control over your system to do what you wish. It assumes you know what you are doing which can be a great thing as well as a bad thing.
It treats all users with respect and gives them powerful tools by doing so. Here's a quote from Doug Gwyn "Unix was not designed to stop its users from doing stupid things, as that would also stop them from doing clever things."

2. A VPS is a computer that is made up, it can be hosted locally on your machine at home or remotely. Or even with amazon or other web service companies.
Using a VPS has many benefits especially with hosting software. It's your private cloud that you can access wherever you'd like and do whatever you want with.
You can use it to run tasks that would require your PC to be on 24/7. Host files, destroy random files and see what it does to the computer. It's your playing field.
