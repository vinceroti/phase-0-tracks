I plan to first use google to find topics on how to get started with jquary and what needs to be done. If the information I'm getting from google doesn't really stick to me then I'll find some instructional youtube videos that I can use to follow along with and lead me in the right direction.

jquary.com seems like the best resource to get started with as well has developers.google.com has some useful information.

Everytime I get through a bunch of code that I'm pretty sure I know works I should stop and test it out, this way I can commit any changes that work the way I want them.

If I find that I'm struggling I'll take a break, I'm pretty hungry anyway so some food sounds pretty good to be honest.

Besides using google and videos, that's are what I'll use to approach this topic. If I find more I'll be sure to add them to this file.

So I found a really helpful tutorial online which got me started with the concept of JQuary and then I used the api.jquery and api.jquaryui site for all the neat effects
